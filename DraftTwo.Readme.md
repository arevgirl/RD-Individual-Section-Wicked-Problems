# Defining Stress and Anxiety

In order to analyze the impacts of mental health on UVU students in a post-pandemic, digital classroom world, understanding mental health and its causes is critical. The uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 global shutdowns have increased anxiety in people internationally. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “[Public health actions, such as social distancing, are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but they can make us feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety.](https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/stress-coping/cope-with-stress/index.html)” Therefore, the most relevant mental health experience to understand in present society is anxiety and stress. 

Anxiety and stress are often used interchangeably—likely because many of their symptoms overlap. However, stress and anxiety are separate experiences. Stress is generally defined as a reaction to pressure or a threat. Anxiety is a common, chronic mental health disorder with the ability to disrupt normal function in a person’s life. Both stress and anxiety can be experienced at different levels of intensity.

Even though stress and anxiety are diagnostically different, anxiety or stress often overlap when we experience them, making them difficult to distinguish. To compare and contrast effectively, stress and anxiety will be analyzed via the internal vs external aspects, their triggers, and their symptoms.

## 1. Internal vs External

One way to tell stress and anxiety apart is to pinpoint whether or not the thing causing stress or anxiety is external or internal. 

As a highly reactive experience, stress is most commonly caused by external factors. When something unexpected occurs, the unexpected is either a threat or a pressure to perform in some capacity. These threats or pressures instigate the fight or flight response. This is because “[[s]tress... [is] a natural part of the fight or flight response and the body’s reaction to danger. The purpose of this response is to ensure a person is alert, focused, and ready to deal with a threat.](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/stress-vs-anxiety)” Because stress is external, stress can be resolved by dealing with the immediate source of stress. Once the external cause of stress is removed, the stress itself goes away. Even in cases where one is stressed for an extended period of time—stress from pursuing a college education for example—the stress still subsides once that source is removed. 

Anxiety, on the other hand, is usually internal. Sometimes, anxiety may start out as a fight or flight response. The key difference is anxiety will be continually experienced even when the original source of stress is no longer present. “[Anxiety is typically characterized by a ‘persistent feeling of apprehension or dread’ in situations that are not actually threatening. Unlike stress, anxiety persists even after a concern has passed.](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/external/2018/06/stress-vs-anxiety/)” This persistent, extended dread can be crippling to everyday life. The devastating nature of anxiety combined with the complexity of an internal source makes anxiety much more difficult to resolve than stress. 

## 2. Triggers

The external nature of stress compared to the internal aspects of anxiety are reflected in their respective triggers. 

### Stress

Because stress has external causes, sudden or drastic changes in one's environment are often the root cause of stress. These changes in environment often include big life events such as the death of a loved one, losing a job, starting college, getting married, a critical health event, and so on. Everyday stress, on the other hand, may be the result of work or family obligations, relational conflicts, upcoming deadlines, or other menial yet personally important concerns. 

The level of stress experienced is generally proportional to the trigger's severity. Smaller, everyday stresses are referred to as acute stresses due to their short-lived, easily resolved nature. On the other hand, triggers that either exist for an extended period of time or are emotionally taxing cause chronic stress. One example of chronic stress might be a demanding job.

Even when one is experiencing only acute stress, stress has the ability to build on top of itself. Therefore, the experienced stress is often a compilation of pressure from various triggers of different severity levels. This layered complexity makes stress relief an important practice for everyone to develop. 

### Anxiety

While stress is proportional to the trigger, "[[a]nxiety [...] is longer lasting and can sometimes seem as if nothing is triggering it; often the feelings of fear or worry are disproportional to the actuality of the event or concern.](https://www.verywellhealth.com/stress-vs-anxiety-5194726)" Anxiety can either be triggered by an existing disorder or by prolonged and overwhelming stress. As such, anxiety triggers vary from person to person. Changes in lifestyle—such as a disruption of sleep patterns or a large intake of caffeine—can be anxiety-inducing. For individuals with varying levels of phobias, anxiety is triggered by interacting with the source of their fears. Other common sources of anxiety might include finances, public speaking, conflict, and so on. Anxiety can also be triggered by chemical imbalances in the body or genetics.

## 3. Symptoms

While stress and anxiety are often thought of as mental or emotional experiences, they impact us physiologically. While stress and anxiety have some shared symptoms, they are also experienced differently in the body. Below is a comprehensive list of some of the most common stress and anxiety symptoms.

Generally, the physiological stress responses are directly initiated by the fight or flight response. This response is evident in symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, rashes, sweaty palms, weakened immune system, feeling overwhelmed, and much more. Contrarily, anxiety has symptoms that are characterized by feeling out of control. Some of these symptoms include restlessness, an unexplainable sense of doom, tingling, numbness, an inability to control thoughts, and so on. Because both stress and anxiety can be triggered by the fight or flight response, they share some common symptoms, the most common being rapid breathing, diarrhea, and constipation. Understanding the symptoms of stress and anxiety may help individuals better recognize which one they are currently experiencing.

## When to Seek Professional Help

While stress and anxiety can often be resolved, sometimes reaching out for professional help is absolutely necessary. If stress or anxiety starts impacting one's daily functioning—mentally, emotionally, physically, relationally, socially, and more—professional help can make all of the difference.

Sometimes underlying physical ailments or illnesses add to stress and anxiety. In those cases, traditional medical care may be exactly what the patient needs. There are also a variety of treatments available specifically for stress and anxiety. There are treatments available for many specific anxiety disorders. These treatments are both available and highly effective. 

Therapy of varying kinds is also available to assist individuals struggling with stress and anxiety. Unfortunately, therapy and mental health, in general, are stigmatized negatively. Taking advantage of therapy is strongly encouraged for all individuals suffering from anxiety and stress of varying severity levels. According to Bridges to Recovery, "one of the best things therapy can do for you, whether or not you get diagnosed with an actual mental illness, is give you the tools you need to practice good mental health" (Ellis). These tools may include coping strategies, recognition of behavioral patterns, and improved thought processes.
