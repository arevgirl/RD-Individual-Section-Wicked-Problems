# Understanding Wicked Problems: Defining Stress and Anxiety

In order to analyze the impacts of mental health on UVU students in a post-pandemic digital classroom world, understanding mental health and its causes are critical. The uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and global shutdowns has increased anxiety in people internationally. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “Public health actions, such as social distancing, are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but they can make us feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety.” Therefore, the most relevant mental health experience to understand in our present society is anxiety and stress. 

Anxiety and stress are often used interchangeably—likely because many of their symptoms overlap. However, stress and anxiety are separate experiences. Stress is generally defined as a reaction to pressure or a threat. Anxiety is a common chronic mental health disorder with the ability to disrupt normal function in a person’s life (Renton). Both stress and anxiety can be experienced at different levels of intensity.

Even though stress and anxiety are diagnostically different, anxiety or stress often overlap when we experience them, making them difficult to distinguish. To compare and contrast effectively, stress and anxiety will be analyzed via the internal vs external aspects, their triggers, and their symptoms.

## 1. Internal vs External

One way to tell stress and anxiety apart is to pinpoint whether or not the thing causing stress or anxiety is external or internal. 

As a highly reactive experience, stress is most commonly caused by external factors. When something unexpected occurs, the unexpected is either a threat or a pressure to perform in some capacity. These threats or pressures trigger what is known as the fight or flight response. This is because “[s]tress... [is] a natural part of the fight or flight response and the body’s reaction to danger. The purpose of this response is to ensure a person is alert, focused, and ready to deal with a threat” (Barrell). As a result of stress being external, stress can often be resolved by taking on the source of your stress head on. Once the external cause of stress is removed, the stress itself goes away. Even in cases where one is stressed for an extended period of time—stress from pursuing a college education for example—the stress still subsides once that source is removed. 

Anxiety, on the other hand, is usually internal. Sometimes, anxiety may start out as a stress fight or flight response. The key difference is anxiety will be continually experienced even when the original source of stress is no longer present. “Anxiety is typically characterized by a ‘persistent feeling of apprehension or dread’ in situations that are not actually threatening. Unlike stress, anxiety persists even after a concern has passed” (Ross). This persistent, extended dread can be crippling to everyday life. The devastating nature of anxiety combined with the complexity of an internal source makes anxiety much more difficult to resolve than stress. 

## 2. Triggers

The external nature of stress compared to the internal aspects of anxiety are reflected in the triggers of each respectively (Renton). 

### Stress

Because stress has external causes, sudden or drastic changes in one's environment are often the root cause of stress. These changes in environment often include big life events such as the death of a loved one, losing a job, starting college, getting married, a critical health event, or any other number of events. We also experience everyday stress that may be the result of work or family obligations, relational conflicts, upcoming deadlines, lack of control, or other menial yet personally important concerns. 

The level of stress we experience is generally proportional to the trigger's severity. Smaller, everyday stresses are referred to as acute stresses due to their short-lived, easily resolved nature. On the other hand, triggers that either exist for an extended period of time or are emotionally taxing cause chronic stress. Some examples of chronic stress might be a demanding job or a difficult breakup.

Even when one is experiencing only acute stress, stress has the ability to build on top of itself. Therefore, the stress we experience is often a compilation of pressure from various triggers of different severity levels. This layered complexity makes stress relief an important skill and practice for everyone to develop. 

### Anxiety

While stress is proportional to the trigger, "[a]nxiety [...] is longer lasting and can sometimes seem as if nothing is triggering it; often the feelings of fear or worry are disproportional to the actuality of the event or concern" (Renton). Anxiety can either be triggered by an existing disorder or by prolonged and overwhelming stress. As such, anxiety triggers vary from person to person. Sometimes, changes in lifestyle—such as a disruption of sleep patterns or a large intake of caffeine—can be anxiety-inducing. For individuals with varying levels of phobias (social anxiety, phobia diagnosis, etc.), anxiety is triggered by interacting with the source of their fears. Other common sources of anxiety might include finances, public speaking, conflict, and so on. Anxiety can also be triggered by chemical imbalances and genetics.

## 3. Symptoms

While stress and anxiety are often thought of mental or emotional experiences, they impact us physiologically. While stress and anxiety have some shared symptoms, they are also experienced differently in the body. Below is a comprehensive list of some of the most common stress and anxiety symptoms.
