# Defining Stress and Anxiety

_By Abigail Elcock_

In order to analyze the impacts of mental health on UVU students in a post-pandemic, digital classroom world, understanding mental health and its causes is critical. The uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 global shutdowns has increased anxiety. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “[Public health actions, such as social distancing, are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but they can make us feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety.](https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/stress-coping/cope-with-stress/index.html)” Therefore, the most relevant mental health experience to understand in present society is anxiety and stress. 

Stress is generally defined as a reaction to pressure or a threat. Anxiety is a common, chronic mental health disorder with the ability to disrupt normal function in a person’s life.

Even though stress and anxiety are diagnostically different, they may be difficult to distinguish. To compare and contrast effectively, stress and anxiety will be analyzed via their internal vs external aspects, their triggers, and their symptoms.

## 1. Internal vs External

Stress is most commonly caused by external factors. When something unexpected occurs, the fight or flight response is instigated. This happens because “[[s]tress... [is] a natural part of the fight or flight response and the body’s reaction to danger. The purpose of this response is to ensure a person is alert, focused, and ready to deal with a threat.](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/stress-vs-anxiety)” Once the external source of stress is removed, the stress goes away. Even when stress lasts for an extended period of time, the stress will subsides once that source is removed.

Anxiety is usually internal and will be continually experienced even when triggers are no longer present. “[Anxiety is typically characterized by a ‘persistent feeling of apprehension or dread’ in situations that are not actually threatening. Unlike stress, anxiety persists even after a concern has passed.](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/external/2018/06/stress-vs-anxiety/)” This persistent, extended dread can be crippling, making anxiety much more difficult to resolve.

## 2. Triggers

Changes in one's environment or everyday responsibilites are often the root causes of stress. The level of stress experienced is proportional to the trigger's severity. Additionally, stress has the ability to build on top of itself. Therefore, the stress people experience is often a compilation of pressure from various triggers of different severity levels. This layered complexity makes stress relief an important practice for everyone to develop.

While stress is proportional to the trigger, "[[a]nxiety [...] is longer lasting and can sometimes seem as if nothing is triggering it; often the feelings of fear or worry are disproportional to the actuality of the event or concern.](https://www.verywellhealth.com/stress-vs-anxiety-5194726)" Anxiety can either be triggered by an existing disorder or by prolonged stress. As such, anxiety triggers vary from person to person. Changes in lifestyle—such as a disruption of sleep patterns or a large intake of caffeine—can be anxiety-inducing. Other common sources of anxiety might include finances, public speaking, conflict, genetic predispositions, and more.

## 3. Symptoms

While stress and anxiety are mental and emotional experiences, they impact us physically as well. Below is a comprehensive list of some of the most common stress and anxiety symptoms.

Physiological stress responses are initiated by the fight or flight response. This response is evident in symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, rashes, sweaty palms, weakened immune system, feeling overwhelmed, and much more. Contrarily, anxiety symptoms are characterized by feeling out of control. Some of these symptoms include restlessness, an unexplainable sense of doom, tingling, numbness, an inability to control thoughts, and so on. Stress and anxiety share some common symptoms: rapid breathing, diarrhea, and constipation. Understanding the symptoms of stress and anxiety may help individuals better recognize what they are experiencing.
